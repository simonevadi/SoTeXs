# List of Simulations folders and the findings


| Folder Name   | Description    | Comments |
|-----|----------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Firs tests  | Simulations here are wrong, the energy in the simulations does not change | 
| 2 | Add 1200l/mm sim, use pd.dataframe for eval  |              |
| 3 | use new framework for one-shot characterization  |              |
| 4 | simulations for the kick-off  |              |
| 5 | adapted the distance between the optical elements  |    The beamline is still too long, m1 is at 12.5 meters and not 12.00 as shown in the floorplan         |
| 6 | shortened the beamline 1.5 meters between m3 and exit slit  |      |
